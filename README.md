# Server Map

A chrome extension to keep track of all your servers.

# The problem
As a part of big data ops team, we had a lot of servers that we had to manage. There was an excel page that was maintained with all the IPs. We had to constanlty open and refer the excel sheet, search particular IP of a particular service. It was really a bad experience and in times of emergency it was really a pain in the a**. 

# Solution
Since most of the developers always had their browsers open at work. It was a good idea to have a chrome extension which would alway be open when you open a new tab and search for a service and get all the servers in that cluster.
