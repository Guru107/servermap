# Server Map

A CLI autocompletion tool to remeber your servers and use it to ssh into a server.

# The problem
As a part of data ops team, we had a lot of servers that we had to manage. There was an excel sheet that was maintained with all the IPs. We had to constanlty open and refer the excel sheet, search particular IP of a particular service. It was really a bad experience and in times of emergency it was really a pain in the a**.

# Solution
A command line tool that scans your ansible inventory file and creates auto completion of your servers so that its easy to ssh into a server
